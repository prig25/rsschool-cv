About me
---

*At this point in my life, I decided to learn the JavaScript programming language. First, I took a course on the [Stepik](https://stepik.org/course/2223/syllabus) website. After that I signed up for the [RS School](https://rs.school/js/) course in 2021. Before I started my programming studies I worked as an electronics engineer. I assembled electronic boards, modules and optical systems for UAVs. I also spent a long time repairing Apple equipment. In general, I was engaged in electronics, mechanics, public networks, assembly of optical-mechanical observation systems, 3D modeling, CNC machines, 3D printing, with different types of composite materials and plastics.*
